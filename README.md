## Additional Features

This is a fork created by Hackin7, meant to add features to make it interoperable with Obsidian.
These features are added

1. WikiLinks - `[[file]]` and `[[file|name]]` wikilink formats work
2. Image Wikilinks - `![[Image]]` links to the correct path

## What is it?
Itâ€™s a file-based wiki that aims to simplicity. The documents are completely written in Markdown which is an easy markup language that you can learn in 60 sec.

## How does it work?
Instead of storing the data in a database I chose to have a file-based system. The advantage of this system is that every file is directly readable inside a terminal etc. Also when you have direct access to the system you can export the files to anything you like.

To view the documents in the browser, the document is converted to html.
